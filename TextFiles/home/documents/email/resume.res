Dear Mr Chomper,
    Thank you for applying to our job posting. It is with regret that I must inform you that we have selected another candidate. Your resume was impressive, you have built so many small games and each with only 24 - 48 hours of development time. You see we had to pass because at AAA Game Comp we work much slower and write tests for every function. Also you should try commenting your code, it will help you later I promise.

Good Luck!
Boss Man
CIO, AAA Game Comp
