Oh good you found my computer! You might ask why someone would bury a computer in their back yard. That is a valid question but to get to the bottom of that mystery it requires some work on you part....

You see I was a game dev like you once. I love cramming hours of development into a weekend for game jams.  I even placed 1st in a Ludum Dare event. Although I made tons of small games and won a few game jams I never published a full game. Probably my life's biggest regret.

Anyway feel free to dig around my computer, since you have already started you might as well continue.

Oh yea I almost forgot, I added a function to this system that the help document doesn't know about. I should update the docs but you can now type load [targetFile.extension] to load different file types. 
Example: 
load funny.gif 
would open a funny meme if it existed within the current directory.
